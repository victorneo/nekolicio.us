Hello. I am Victor, and I am based in sunny
[Singapore](https://goo.gl/maps/1dW9WEpN43n7wRQi9).

I currently work at ALPHA Camp as a Student Success Director, focused on the
flagship Full-Stack web development course, and developing new courses aimed at
developers.

Previously, I was Employee #1 at Carousell, and took on multiple Engineering
Leadership roles as the Engineering team grew from 5 to over 100 engineers.

If you are looking for book recommendations on Management or Engineering
Management, you can check out my [GoodReads list](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/23479859-victor-neo?shelf=management&sort=rating)

Mysteries and thrillers books are my favourite, so I do have a list to track
